## PRISMA 2020 expanded checklist

*Note: This expanded checklist details elements recommended for reporting for each PRISMA 2020 item. Non-italicized elements are considered 'essential' and should be reported in the main report or as supplementary material for all systematic reviews (except for those preceded by "If...", which should only be reported where applicable). Elements written in italics are 'additional', and while not essential, provide supplementary information that may enhance the completeness and usability of systematic review reports. Note that elements presented here are an abridged version of those presented in the explanation and elaboration paper (BMJ 2021;372:n160), with references and some examples removed. Consulting the explanation and elaboration paper is recommended if further clarity or information is required.*

| RESULTS | REPORTING BIASES | 21 | If a test for funnel plot asymmetry was used, report the exact P value observed for the test, and potentially other relevant statistics, for example the standardised normal deviate, from which the P value is derived. | Essential |
| RESULTS | REPORTING BIASES | 21 | If any sensitivity analyses seeking to explore the potential impact of missing results on the synthesis were conducted, present results of each analysis (see item #20d), compare them with results of the primary analysis, and report results with due consideration of the limitations of the statistical method. | Where applicable |
| RESULTS | REPORTING BIASES | 21 | If studies were assessed for selective non-reporting of results by comparing outcomes and analyses pre-specified in study registers, protocols, and statistical analysis plans with results that were available in study reports, consider presenting a matrix (with rows as studies and columns as syntheses) to present the availability of study results. | Where applicable |
| RESULTS | REPORTING BIASES | 21 | If an assessment of selective non-reporting of results reveals that some studies are missing from the synthesis, consider displaying the studies with missing results underneath a forest plot or including a table with the available study results. | Where applicable |
| RESULTS | CERTAINTY OF EVIDENCE | 22 | Report the overall level of certainty (or confidence) in the body of evidence for each important outcome. | Essential |
| RESULTS | CERTAINTY OF EVIDENCE | 22 | Provide an explanation of reasons for rating down (or rating up) the certainty of evidence (e.g. in footnotes to an evidence summary table). | Essential |
| RESULTS | CERTAINTY OF EVIDENCE | 22 | Communicate certainty in the evidence wherever results are reported (i.e. abstract, evidence summary tables, results, conclusions), using a format appropriate for the section of the review. | Essential |
| RESULTS | CERTAINTY OF EVIDENCE | 22 | Consider including evidence summary tables, such as GRADE Summary of Findings tables. | Where applicable |
| DISCUSSION | DISCUSSION | 23a | Provide a general interpretation of the results in the context of other evidence. | Essential |
| DISCUSSION | DISCUSSION | 23b | Discuss any limitations of the evidence included in the review. | Essential |
| DISCUSSION | DISCUSSION | 23c | Discuss any limitations of the review processes used, and comment on the potential impact of each limitation. | Essential |
| DISCUSSION | DISCUSSION | 23d | Discuss implications of the results for practice and policy. | Essential |
| DISCUSSION | DISCUSSION | 23d | Make explicit recommendations for future research. | Essential |
| OTHER INFORMATION | REGISTRATION AND PROTOCOL | 24a | Provide registration information for the review, including register name and registration number, or state that the review was not registered. | Essential |
| OTHER INFORMATION | REGISTRATION AND PROTOCOL | 24b | Indicate where the review protocol can be accessed (e.g. by providing a citation, DOI or link), or state that a protocol was not prepared. | Essential |
| OTHER INFORMATION | REGISTRATION AND PROTOCOL | 24c | Report details of any amendments to information provided at registration or in the protocol, noting: (a) the amendment itself; (b) the reason for the amendment; and (c) the stage of the review process at which the amendment was implemented. | Essential |
| OTHER INFORMATION | SUPPORT | 25 | Describe sources of financial or non-financial support for the review, specifying relevant grant ID numbers for each funder. If no specific financial or non-financial support was received, this should be stated. | Essential |
| OTHER INFORMATION | SUPPORT | 25 | Describe the role of the funders or sponsors (or both) in the review. If funders or sponsors had no role in the review, this should be declared. | Essential |
| OTHER INFORMATION | COMPETING INTERESTS | 26 | Disclose any of the authors' relationships or activities that readers could consider pertinent or to have influenced the review. | Essential |
| OTHER INFORMATION | COMPETING INTERESTS | 26 | If any authors had competing interests, report how they were managed for particular review processes. | Where applicable |
| OTHER INFORMATION | AVAILABILITY OF DATA, CODE, AND OTHER MATERIALS | 27 | Report which of the following are publicly available: template data collection forms; data extracted from included studies; data used for all analyses; analytic code; any other materials used in the review. | Essential |
| OTHER INFORMATION | AVAILABILITY OF DATA, CODE, AND OTHER MATERIALS | 27 | If any of the above materials are publicly available, report where they can be found (e.g. provide a link to files deposited in a public repository). | Where applicable |
| OTHER INFORMATION | AVAILABILITY OF DATA, CODE, AND OTHER MATERIALS | 27 | If data, analytic code, or other materials will be made available upon request, provide the contact details of the author responsible for sharing the materials and describe the circumstances under which such materials will be shared. | Where applicable |
