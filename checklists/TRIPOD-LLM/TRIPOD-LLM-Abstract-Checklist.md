## Table 3 TRIPOD-LLM for abstracts

From: The TRIPOD-LLM reporting guideline for studies using large language models

| Section | Item | Checklist item | Research Design | LLM Task | Reported on page |
|---------|------|---------------|-----------------|----------|------------------|
| Title | 2a | Identify the study as developing, fine-tuning and/or evaluating the performance of an LLM, specifying the task, the target population and the outcome to be predicted. | All | All |  |
| Background | 2b | Provide a brief explanation of the healthcare context, use case and rationale for developing or evaluating the performance of an LLM. | E H | All |  |
| Objectives | 2c | Specify the study objectives, including whether the study describes LLMs development, tuning and/or evaluation | All | All |  |
| Methods | 2d | Describe the key elements of the study setting. | All | All |  |
| Methods | 2e | Detail all data used in the study, specify data splits and any selective use of data. | M D E | All |  |
| Methods | 2f | Specify the name and version of LLM(s) used. | All | All |  |
| Methods | 2g | Briefly summarize the LLM-building steps, including any fine-tuning, reward modeling and RLHF. | M D | All |  |
| Methods | 2h | Describe the specific tasks performed by the LLMs (for example, medical QA, summarization and extraction), highlighting key inputs and outputs used in the final LLM. | All | All |  |
| Methods | 2i | Specify the evaluation datasets/populations used, including the endpoint evaluated, and detail whether this information was held out during training/tuning where relevant and what measure(s) were used to evaluate LLM performance. | All | All |  |
| Results | 2j | Give an overall report and interpretation of the main results. | All | All |  |
| Discussion | 2k | Explicitly state any broader implications or concerns that have arisen in light of these results. | All | All |  |
| Other | 2l | Give the registration number and name of the registry or repository (if relevant). | H | All |  |

LLM = large language model; M = LLM methods; D = de novo LLM development; E = LLM evaluation; H = LLM evaluation in healthcare settings; RLHF, reinforcement learning with human feedback.
