| Statistical methods | 12 | (a) Describe all statistical methods, including those used to control for confounding<br>(b) Describe any methods used to examine subgroups and interactions<br>(c) Explain how missing data were addressed<br>(d) Cohort study - If applicable, explain how loss to follow-up was addressed<br>Case-control study - If applicable, explain how matching of cases and controls was addressed<br>Cross-sectional study - If applicable, describe analytical methods taking account of sampling strategy<br>(e) Describe any sensitivity analyses | | | |
| Data access and cleaning methods | .. | | RECORD 12.1: Authors should describe the extent to which the investigators had access to the database population used to create the study population.<br><br>RECORD 12.2: Authors should provide information on the data cleaning methods used in the study. | |
| Linkage | .. | | RECORD 12.3: State whether the study included person-level, institutional-level, or other data linkage across two or more databases. The methods of linkage and methods of linkage quality evaluation should be provided. | |
| **Results** |  |  |  |  |
| Participants | 13 | (a) Report the numbers of individuals at each stage of the study (e.g., numbers potentially eligible, examined for eligibility, confirmed eligible, included in the study, completing follow-up, and analysed)<br>(b) Give reasons for non-participation at each stage.<br>(c) Consider use of a flow diagram | | RECORD 13.1: Describe in detail the selection of the persons included in the study (i.e., study population selection) including filtering based on data quality, data availability and linkage. The selection of included persons can be described in the text and/or by means of the study flow diagram. | |
| Descriptive data | 14 | (a) Give characteristics of study participants (e.g., demographic, clinical, social) and information on exposures and potential confounders<br>(b) Indicate the number of participants with missing data for each variable of interest<br>(c) Cohort study - summarise follow-up time (e.g., average and total amount) | | | |
| Outcome data | 15 | Cohort study - Report numbers of outcome events or summary measures over time<br>Case-control study - Report numbers in each exposure category, or summary measures of exposure<br>Cross-sectional study - Report numbers of outcome events or summary measures | | | |
| Main results | 16 | (a) Give unadjusted estimates and, if applicable, confounder-adjusted estimates and their precision (e.g., 95% confidence interval). Make clear which confounders were adjusted for and why they were included<br>(b) Report category boundaries when continuous variables were categorized<br>(c) If relevant, consider translating estimates of relative risk into absolute risk for a meaningful time period | | | |
| Other analyses | 17 | Report other analyses done—e.g., analyses of subgroups and interactions, and sensitivity analyses | | | |
