| Methods | Statistical methods | 12d | Cohort | If applicable, explain how loss to follow-up was addressed |
| Methods | Statistical methods | 12d | Case-control | If applicable, explain how matching of cases and controls was addressed |

| Methods | Statistical methods | 12e | All | Describe any sensitivity analyses |
| Results | Participants | 13a* | All | Report numbers of individuals at each stage of study—eg numbers potentially eligible, examined for eligibility, confirmed eligible, included in the study, completing follow-up, and analysed |
| Results | Participants | 13b* | All | Give reasons for non-participation at each stage |
| Results | Participants | 13c* | All | Consider use of a flow diagram |
| Results | Descriptive data | 14a* | All | Give characteristics of study participants (eg demographic, clinical, social) and information on exposures and potential confounders |
| Results | Descriptive data | 14b* | All | Indicate number of participants with missing data for each variable of interest |
| Results | Descriptive data | 14c* | Cohort | Summarise follow-up time (eg, average and total amount) |
| Results | Outcome data | 15* | Cohort | Report numbers of outcome events or summary measures over time |
| Results | Outcome data | 15* | Case-control | Report numbers in each exposure category, or summary measures of exposure |
| Results | Outcome data | 15* | Cross-sectional | Report numbers of outcome events or summary measures |
| Results | Main results | 16a | All | Give unadjusted estimates and, if applicable, confounder-adjusted estimates and their precision (eg, 95% confidence interval). Make clear which confounders were adjusted for and why they were included |
| Results | Main results | 16b | All | Report category boundaries when continuous variables were categorized |
| Results | Main results | 16c | All | If relevant, consider translating estimates of relative risk into absolute risk for a meaningful time period |
| Results | Other analyses | 17 | All | Report other analyses done—eg analyses of subgroups and interactions, and sensitivity analyses |
| Discussion | Key results | 18 | All | Summarise key results with reference to study objectives |
| Discussion | Limitations | 19 | All | Discuss limitations of the study, taking into account sources of potential bias or imprecision. Discuss both direction and magnitude of any potential bias |
| Discussion | Interpretation | 20 | All | Give a cautious overall interpretation of results considering objectives, limitations, multiplicity of analyses, results from similar studies, and other relevant evidence |
| Discussion | Generalisability | 21 | All | Discuss the generalisability (external validity) of the study results |
| Other information | Funding | 22 | All | Give the source of funding and the role of the funders for the present study and, if applicable, for the original study on which the present article is based |

*Give information separately for cases and controls in case-control studies and, if applicable, for exposed and unexposed groups in cohort and cross-sectional studies.
