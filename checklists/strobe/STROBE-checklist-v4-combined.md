| Study design | 4 | Present key elements of study design early in the paper |
| Setting | 5 | Describe the setting, locations, and relevant dates, including periods of recruitment, exposure, follow-up, and data collection |
| Participants | 6 | (a) Cohort study—Give the eligibility criteria, and the sources and methods of selection of participants. Describe methods of follow-up<br>Case-control study—Give the eligibility criteria, and the sources and methods of case ascertainment and control selection. Give the rationale for the choice of cases and controls<br>Cross-sectional study—Give the eligibility criteria, and the sources and methods of selection of participants |
|  | | (b) Cohort study—For matched studies, give matching criteria and number of exposed and unexposed<br>Case-control study—For matched studies, give matching criteria and the number of controls per case |
| Variables | 7 | Clearly define all outcomes, exposures, predictors, potential confounders, and effect modifiers. Give diagnostic criteria, if applicable |
| Data sources/ measurement | 8* | For each variable of interest, give sources of data and details of methods of assessment (measurement). Describe comparability of assessment methods if there is more than one group |
| Bias | 9 | Describe any efforts to address potential sources of bias |
| Study size | 10 | Explain how the study size was arrived at |
| Quantitative variables | 11 | Explain how quantitative variables were handled in the analyses. If applicable, describe which groupings were chosen and why |
| Statistical methods | 12 | (a) Describe all statistical methods, including those used to control for confounding |
|  | | (b) Describe any methods used to examine subgroups and interactions |
|  | | (c) Explain how missing data were addressed |
|  | | (d) Cohort study—If applicable, explain how loss to follow-up was addressed<br>Case-control study—If applicable, explain how matching of cases and controls was addressed<br>Cross-sectional study—If applicable, describe analytical methods taking account of sampling strategy |
|  | | (e) Describe any sensitivity analyses |
| **Results** | |
| Participants | 13* | (a) Report numbers of individuals at each stage of study—eg numbers potentially eligible, examined for eligibility, confirmed eligible, included in the study, completing follow-up, and analysed |
|  | | (b) Give reasons for non-participation at each stage |
|  | | (c) Consider use of a flow diagram |
| Descriptive data | 14* | (a) Give characteristics of study participants (eg demographic, clinical, social) and information on exposures and potential confounders |
|  | | (b) Indicate number of participants with missing data for each variable of interest |
|  | | (c) Cohort study—Summarise follow-up time (eg, average and total amount) |
| Outcome data | 15* | Cohort study—Report numbers of outcome events or summary measures over time<br>Case-control study—Report numbers in each exposure category, or summary measures of exposure<br>Cross-sectional study—Report numbers of outcome events or summary measures |
| Main results | 16 | (a) Give unadjusted estimates and, if applicable, confounder-adjusted estimates and their precision (eg, 95% confidence interval). Make clear which confounders were adjusted for and why they were included |
|  | | (b) Report category boundaries when continuous variables were categorized |
|  | | (c) If relevant, consider translating estimates of relative risk into absolute risk for a meaningful time period |
| Other analyses | 17 | Report other analyses done—eg analyses of subgroups and interactions, and sensitivity analyses |
| **Discussion** | |
| Key results | 18 | Summarise key results with reference to study objectives |
| Limitations | 19 | Discuss limitations of the study, taking into account sources of potential bias or imprecision. Discuss both direction and magnitude of any potential bias |
| Interpretation | 20 | Give a cautious overall interpretation of results considering objectives, limitations, multiplicity of analyses, results from similar studies, and other relevant evidence |
| Generalisability | 21 | Discuss the generalisability (external validity) of the study results |
| **Other information** | |
| Funding | 22 | Give the source of funding and the role of the funders for the present study and, if applicable, for the original study on which the present article is based |

*Give information separately for cases and controls in case-control studies and, if applicable, for exposed and unexposed groups in cohort and cross-sectional studies.
