# Reporting Guidelines Markdown Collection

## Overview
This repository provides reporting guidelines widely used in medicine and public health fields in markdown format with Mermaid diagrams. The aim is to convert original PDF or document format guidelines into formats that are more accessible for AI and automation tools. Note that each checklist has been partially modified to maintain proper table formatting in markdown.

## Benefits of Markdown and Mermaid Diagrams
Converting original PDF format guidelines to markdown and Mermaid diagrams offers the following advantages:

1. **Improved machine readability**: Facilitates analysis and processing with AI tools
2. **Version control**: Changes can be tracked using version control systems like Git
3. **Search and reference**: Text-based format makes it easy to search for specific items or requirements
4. **Web display**: Optimized for display on platforms like GitHub Pages
5. **Automated checking tools**: Can be used for automatic checking of papers and protocols
